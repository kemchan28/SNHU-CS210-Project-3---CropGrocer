This project is for a starting groccery company and is in need of efficient code that will be a 
item-tracking program for the new company Corner Crocer. This is to help indicate popular items 
purchased by the customers to help rearrange the layout to make it more efficient for their customers.

Over all was able to execute what the company was looking for by blending in two coding languages into 
one mass program that will continuously run a item-tracking program. It will indicate the inventory 
daily from the time the store opens til close and monitor and take account of the items the customers 
are taking. This will help indicate the popular items and help rearrange the layout for a more efficient
layout. 

Some changes that could have help to enhance the code is inputting more comments to indicate what section 
of code is and the role specific lines of coding are doing. These improvements would not affect overall 
functionality of the code but will help make it easier to read and follow along the process of each section. 

The most challengign part of the project was finding a way to blend in both C++ as well as python into one 
program without creating any conflicts or errors in either language. This was able to be overcome by doing 
a lot of research in regards of the proper commands and necessary coding needed to make sure the two different 
languages will talk to each other as intended. 

From this project help developed skills in coding, execution, and being able to integrate two languages
together into one project. These skills are key to help with further understanding of upcoming course works
by understanding the coding processes as well as necessary classes or calls to make sure there is no 
issues during execution. 

This program was maintainable by trying not to make it over complicated with simplicity as its main focus to 
help make it easy to follow along for undersanding its execution. Aside its simplicity making sure it was readable 
was also key by having the necessary white spaces to space out the code to make it easier to read as well as some 
comments throughout the code to make sure it runs correctly as intended. Lastly this project was adaptable in the
aspect of having two different coding languages being utilized within this assignment.
